# Robotic Arm Repository

The inverse kinematics for the rover's 6 DOF robotic arm was developed in this repository.

Here, you can find the c++ and c# codes used in calculation of the robotic arm's inverse kinematics. The feedback values were take from encoders on the arm and then these are used to calculate the best path via inverse kinematics.
